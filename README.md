🧭 Pokemon Game?

It’s a personal project, a proving ground, and a collection of "that’ll do" code solutions held together by sheer force of will and caffeine.

🎮 What's This All About?

Think: top-down pixel adventure, minimal graphics, maximal learning.
I'm using this game to explore:

Java game loops
Map handling
Collision systems
Entity updates
Object interactions
Crying when NullPointerException appears in the console
This is not a polished indie title destined for Steam (yet). It's where I try out new mechanics, mess with architecture, and learn by doing (and debugging... a lot of debugging).

🧪 Features (Subject to Spontaneous Breakage)

🚶 Player movement via keyboard
🗺️ Tile-based map rendering
🎯 Collision detection (with optional rage when it fails)
🎒 Inventory and item interaction framework
🧱 Modular code with a sprinkle of organized chaos
🛠️ Built With

Java (the beverage of choice for most IDEs)
IntelliJ IDEA (because I enjoy the pain of 500-line stack traces in a friendly UI)
🚀 Getting Started

Requirements
Java 8+ (or something close enough)
IntelliJ (or your IDE of choice — if you're feeling brave)
Patience
Run Instructions
Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/gjfranics9/AdventureGame.git
Open in IntelliJ (File > Open > point to the directory).
Run the Main class.
Watch a window appear. Be amazed.
🗂️ Project Structure (Roughly Speaking)

AdventureGame/
├── src/
│   ├── main/            # Actual game code lives here
│   └── test/            # Some JUnit tests for when I'm feeling responsible
├── res/                 # Player sprites and map files
└── pokemonProject.iml   # Shhh... it's a legacy name
🎮 Controls

Arrow keys: Move around
E (eventually): Interact (probably)
ESC: Exit, when it’s all too much
🧠 Why This Exists

I wanted to build something that lets me:

Apply OOP principles to a real(-ish) project
Break large problems into smaller bugs
Practice test writing (because apparently that’s important)
Have fun making something entirely mine
And if it helps someone else learn along the way — or makes them laugh at my method names — even better.

💡 TODO (aka the Wish List)

A battle system
Usable items
NPCs
Interactable tiles
Any UI features (Who knows)
Multiple maps with connecting portals


It’s a solo project for now, but feel free to fork, star, laugh, or steal code responsibly. If you’ve got ideas or spot bugs, pull requests are welcome (no promises I won’t break it again later).

📜 License

MIT — because sharing is caring.

I used RyiSnow's Java 2D game development tutorial to help with a lot of the code but I've added my fair share of unique mechanics and designs - hopefully will diverge from it more and more (That will take a lot more time)

Made with Java, mild despair, and a genuine love of learning.
